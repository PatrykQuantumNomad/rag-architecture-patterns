# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** Produce reproducible, honest numbers for the blog — every claim backed by a captured run with full provenance.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 (Tier 5 Adapter Fix)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Tier 5 Adapter Fix)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (Plan 01 complete; Plan 02 next)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-05-04 — Phase 01 Plan 01 executed (Tier 5 adapter walk + tracing toggle)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 11%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0 scope: fix-and-ship the existing 5 tiers; no new architectures, no new questions
- Multi-judge spot-check (CAP-02) is in v1.0 scope as *measurement* (5q × 3 tiers); full mitigation deferred to v1.1
- Single eval-date for all 5 tiers; budget ~$1-3 per full rerun, 2-3 reruns total
- Tier 4 MineRU ingest must run outside the sandbox (Phase 139 evidence)
- Tier 5 adapter reads `item.output` not `item.raw_item` (Pitfall 1 of 132-RESEARCH HARD invariant) — `raw_item` is a stringified Responses-API payload
- Tier 5 contexts deduped first-occurrence-wins on `(paper_id, page)` for chunks and `(paper_id)` for metadata abstracts
- Tier 5 tracing toggle gated on `RAG_DEBUG_TIER5_TRACING` env var (default disabled — byte-identical behavior; opt-in for OpenInference fallback)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tier 5 root cause is high-confidence (5-line adapter bug at `tier_5.py:125`) but Phase 1 must include a fallback path: if smoke test still shows empty contexts after the fix, follow STACK.md decision tree (simplify schema → switch model slug → bump openai-agents) before declaring done
- OpenRouter passthrough may obscure the exact Gemini model version (`gemini-2.5-flash-001` vs bare `gemini-2.5-flash`) for provenance; Phase 9 must document the version-unknown case explicitly if unresolvable
