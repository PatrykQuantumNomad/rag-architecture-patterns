## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0 scope: fix-and-ship the existing 5 tiers; no new architectures, no new questions
- Multi-judge spot-check (CAP-02) is in v1.0 scope as *measurement* (5q × 3 tiers); full mitigation deferred to v1.1
- Single eval-date for all 5 tiers; budget ~$1-3 per full rerun, 2-3 reruns total
- Tier 4 MineRU ingest must run outside the sandbox (Phase 139 evidence)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tier 5 root cause is high-confidence (5-line adapter bug at `tier_5.py:125`) but Phase 1 must include a fallback path: if smoke test still shows empty contexts after the fix, follow STACK.md decision tree (simplify schema → switch model slug → bump openai-agents) before declaring done
- OpenRouter passthrough may obscure the exact Gemini model version (`gemini-2.5-flash-001` vs bare `gemini-2.5-flash`) for provenance; Phase 9 must document the version-unknown case explicitly if unresolvable
